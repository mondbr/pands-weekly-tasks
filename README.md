# Programming and Scripting

author: Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for solutions to the weekly tasks for Programming and Scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/).

I don't have any prevoius programming experience nor knowledge of basing coding, so I am using multiple sources and references to help me to complete the assignments. 

Each file contains comments to the code I am writing. Below I will explain my approach to solving the assigned task and reference the sources I researched for solving the problems.

# [Weekly tasks](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks)


#### [Weekly task 01 - *helloworld.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/helloworld.py)

    Commit and push a file to the weekly tasks repository.
    This file should contain a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.

A simple and traditional "Hello World!" program is often used as the first example when learning a new programming language or environment. It's designed to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language by printing the text "Hello World!" to the output.

The output is: 

    Hello World!


#### [Weekly task 02 - *bank.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/bank.py)

    Write a program that should:

    Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
    Add the two amounts
    Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount

I started with code to ask the user and read in two money amounts (in cent), then program add two amounts and convert it to two decimal numbers. 
The idea of how to take the sum of cents and convert it to represent money using decimal numbers was taken from [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8637628/how-to-use-python-string-formatting-to-convert-an-integer-representing-cents-to) .

The program is called: 

    $ python bank.py


User input:

    Enter your username: mondbr
    Enter amount1(in cent): 65
    Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The output is:

    The sum of these is â‚¬2.45
