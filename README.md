# Programming and Scripting

author: Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for solutions to the weekly tasks for Programming and Scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/).

I don't have any prevoius programming experience nor knowledge of basing coding, so I am using multiple sources and references to help me to complete the assignments. 

Each file contains comments to the code I am writing. Below I will explain my approach to solving the assigned task and reference the sources I researched for solving the problems.

# Weekly tasks


#### [Weekly task 01 - *helloworld.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/helloworld.py)

    Commit and push a file to the weekly tasks repository.
    This file should contain a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.

A simple and traditional "Hello World!" program is often used as the first example when learning a new programming language or environment. It's designed to demonstrate the basic syntax and structure of a programming language by printing the text "Hello World!" to the output.

The output is: 

    Hello World!


#### [Weekly task 02 - *bank.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/bank.py)

    Write a program that should:

    Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
    Add the two amounts
    Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and 
    decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount

I started with code to ask the user and read in two money amounts (in cents). Then the program adds the two amounts and converts it to two decimal numbers.  
The idea of how to take the sum of cents and convert it to represent money using decimal numbers was taken from [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8637628/how-to-use-python-string-formatting-to-convert-an-integer-representing-cents-to).

The program is called: 

    $ python bank.py


User input:

    Enter your username: mondbr
    Enter amount1(in cent): 65
    Enter amount2(in cent): 180

The output is:

    The sum of these is â‚¬2.45



#### [Weekly task 03 - *accoutns.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/accounts.py)

    Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and 
    outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing 
    (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

This week, we were looking at variables in Python. The program I needed to write was very interesting to me because working with bank account numbers is related to my education and work experience. I started with code to ask the user to enter exactly a 10-digit number (bank account number). If the number of digits was incorrect, the program prompts an error message and asks to re-enter the number. Once the correct number is entered, the program replaces the first 6 digits with 'X', similar to what we can see in bank or card numbers, where specific numbers are encrypted for security reasons. The idea of how to replace digits was taken from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_string_replace).


The program is called: 
        
    $ accounts.py

User input:

    Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890

The output is:

    XXXXXX7890
    
The error message if the number of digits is incorrect:

User input:

    Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234

The output is:

    Invalid account number. Please enter exaclty 10 digits





#### [Weekly task 03 Extra - *accounts_extra.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/accounts_extra.py)

    Extra:
    Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length
    (yes that is a vague requirement, comment your assumptions)

This was an extra task to modify the program I wrote in topic 03. It allowed me to approach the problem differently. 
My assumptions were that the account number entered should have at least 4 digits so the program can replace any number of digits with 'x', while leaving the last 4 digits visible. I used a very popular tool nowadays to help me with it - AI - [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/). With that powerful support, I learned how to replace a specific number of digits with an 'x' while the user can enter a number of any length (when requirements are met).


The program is called: 
        
    $ accounts_extra.py

User input:

    Please enter an account number with at least 4 digits: 123456

The output is:

    xx3456
    
The error message if the number of digits is incorrect:

User input:

    Please enter an account number with at least 4 digits: 12

The output is:

    Invalid account number. Please enter a valid account number with at least 4 digits



#### [Weekly task 04 - *collatz.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/collatz.py)

    Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer 
    and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
    At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, 
    but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
    Have the program end if the current value is one.

In topic 04 we were looking at if statements and while and for loops. In the weekly task 04 I needed to write a program that will represent the Collatz conjecture. It is also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture or Collatz problem. It's a mathematical problem that involves iterating a particular sequence based on a simple rule. The rule is as follows:

    1. Start with any positive integer n
    2. If n is even, divide it by 2 (n / 2)
    3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (3n + 1)
    4. Repeat the process with the new value of n obtained in step 2 or 3.

The conjecture posits that no matter what positive integer you start with, this sequence will eventually reach 1. However, proving or disproving this conjecture remains an unsolved problem in mathematics, despite being easy to understand and experiment with computationally. 

To write this program I was refferencing to materials availabe on w3schools.com [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_def.asp) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp). Also I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAp_5qTdOhM) very informative. 

The program is called: 

    $ collatz.py

User input:

    Please enter a positive integer: 10

The output is:

    Collatz sequence: 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

The assumption is that the number must be positive. The error message if the number is negative:

User input:

    Please enter a positive integer: -10

The output is:
    
    Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.



#### [Weekly task 05 - *weekday.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/weekday.py)

    Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.
    You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.

In topic 05 we were learning about lists, tuples and dictionaries and how we can use them in programming. This week task required a bit more research of how to approach to it. I decided to use the *import datetime* statement in Python that is used to import the datetime module, which provides classes and methods for working with dates and times. This module is part of the Python standard library. I found the information on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp). The idea of how to get the current date and time and the *weekday()* method that returns the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6 was taken from [shecodes.io](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/10185-how-to-check-what-day-of-the-week-it-is-in-python).


The output from Monday to Friday is:

    Is today a weekday?
    Yes, unfotunately today is a weekday :( 

The output on Saturday and Sunday is:

    It is a weekend, yay! :)



#### [Weekly task 06 - *squareroot.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/squareroot.py)


    Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
    You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
    I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
    This is to demonstrate that you can research and code a process (If you really needed the square root you would use one of the above methods). 
    I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots. 

In topic 06 we were looking at *if* statements and *while* and *for* loops. Weekly task required a good understanding the logic of Newton method before I could put the calculation in the code - I found that the process clicked after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpOEx6zFf1o). 
This task required from the students to create their own function rather than using built-in function. 


Newton method is that for any number N, the square root is 0.5 * (X + N / X).

I have created my own function *sqrt(x)*.  First I needed to check if the number is positive, as the assumption of this method is that the number must be positive. I used *if* statement and *abs()* module to get the positive floating number from the user input. 

In the function, variable *guess*  is defined as an initial guess that first iteration equals to the number we want to root. Variable *x* was the user input.
Next, in the *while* loop we are checking next guess which is the Newton method 0.5 * (X + N / X). I am using *if* statement to get the closest value of the difference between iterations. It is updating current guess to be the value of the next guess until the difference between them is small (less than 0,001). Then loop stops and returns the square root number rounded to the first decimal place. 


The program is called: 

    $ squareroot.py

User input:

    Please enter a positive number: 14.5

The output is:

    The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.


The assumption is that the number must be positive, so I aded a check if the number is a positive number and using *abs()* module to convert negative number to be positive.

User input:

    Please enter a positive number: -14.5

The output is:
    
    This is a negative number, we need a positive number.
    Let me fix this negative number to be positive: 14.5
    The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.



#### [Weekly task 07 - *es.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/es.py)

    Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. 
    Think about what is being asked here, document any assumptions you are making.
    The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. 
    Marks will be given for dealing with errors eg no argument, filename that does not exist, or is not a text file.


This task required tons of research in order to meet all the requierements. I started with importing two modules: *sys* and *os*. 

Using *sys* module, with the information taken from [Quora.com](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-pass-a-list-of-file-names-as-a-command-line-argument-to-a-Python-script) I could take a command line argument that reads the file I selected. Using the *sys.argv[1]* variable, I defined that the filename is second argument when calling a program - *sys.argv[0]* is the program we are trying to start - which will be a *es.py* in this case. 

Using *os* module I could check for various conditions such as file does not exist, or a file that is not a text file. 
Reference to the *os* module is [Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-check-if-a-file-exists-in-python) and [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57007680/how-to-handle-the-exception-when-input-file-does-not-exists-in-python)

Using *file_name,'r'* function I opened a file that we called in the command line argument *moby-dick.txt*, and make it available just for reading *r*. For counting the lower letter 'e' and upper case letter 'E' I used the method *count()*.  

The program is called: 

    $ es.py moby-dick.txt

The output is a simple number:

    59646

The assumption is that the file exist. If not, the error message is prompting:

    File does not exist

Another assumption is that the file is a txt file. If not, the error message is prompting:

    File is not a text file




#### [Weekly task 08 - *plottask.py*](https://github.com/mondbr/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/plottask.py)

    Write a program called plottask.py that displays:
    a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
    and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes. 
    Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice (legend etc).


I generating a dataset (data) of 1000 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2 using NumPy. 
This dataset can be used for various statistical analyses or for plotting histograms and other visualizations.
